- When multiply 2 high-dimension matrices, only need to pay attention to the 2 last dimension
- contiguous in Python: -> advantageous
- post-norm (original Trans) VS pre-norm (+a final norm)
    + original trans: no final norm :real?
- in decoder/encoder, we have to use different dropout in different processes(not 1 for all)
- for speed up training, you may use mps device (on mac) by init device -> mps and move all necessary things to device
- in test.py, maybe add beam_search_decode for comparing the results returned by 2 approaches (use 100 pairs...)
